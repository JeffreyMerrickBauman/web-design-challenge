    The purpose of this project was to analyze
    how weather changes as you get closer to the 
    equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first
    pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to 
    assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.
<br>
<br>
After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib
to plot various aspects of the weather vs. 
latitude. Factors we looked at included: temperature,
cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site 
provides the source data and visualizations created
as part of the analysis, as well as explanations 
and descriptions of any trends and correlations 
witnessed.
